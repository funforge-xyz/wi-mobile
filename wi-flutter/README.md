## How to run/debug

- [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Clone this repo
- Open the project folder in VS Code
- Connect device or launch emulator
- **Run** > **Start Debugging** or **Run Without Debugging**. If asked for Environment, choose "Dart & Flutter".

If you prefer a CLI, see [this article](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-and-the-command-line-a-love-story-a3648ef2411).
